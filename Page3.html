    <h3 style="color: green;">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows you to control the appearance of web pages, enabling designers and developers to create visually appealing and consistent styles across a website.</h3>

    <hr>
    <h2 style="color: green;">1.</h2>
    <h3 style="color: green;">Separation of Content and Style: CSS separates the content (HTML) from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update websites. This separation allows for cleaner, more efficient code.</h3>
    <h2 style="color: green;">2.</h2>
    <h3 style="color: green;">Styling Options: CSS offers a wide range of styling capabilities, including:
        Colors and Fonts: Control text color, background color, font family, size, and weight.
        Layout: Position elements using techniques like flexbox, grid, margins, padding, and positioning.
        Responsive Design: Use media queries to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</h3>
        <h2 style="color: green;">3.</h2>
        <h3 style="color: green;">Cascading Order: CSS rules can cascade, meaning that styles can be applied in a specific order, with the most specific rules taking precedence over more general ones. This allows for flexibility and overrides.</h3>
        <h2 style="color: green;">4.</h2>
        <h3 style="color: green;">Selectors: CSS uses various selectors to target HTML elements, such as element selectors (e.g., h1), class selectors (e.g., .classname), and ID selectors (e.g., #idname).</h3>
